                (RTE), 4 SKUs in the Ready to Cook (RTC), and 10

                flakes, rawa (Semolina), porridge and pops
                (equivalent of popcorn with millets). The staples

                company has production lines set up for flaking,
                semolina making and popping. The products are
                manufactured in batches, for eg: the raw material
                batch size for production of ragi flakes is 150 kgs.
                Although the total processing capacity is 700
                Kg/day, the company currently operates at a capacity
                utilization of 45% given the limited space for

                products that are similar to mainstream products but

                are affordable when compared to a similar product

                offers multiple options to the consumers within the
                same category (eg: Flakes: Ragi flakes, Jowar flakes

                being developed in the large research institutions;
                Company is an early adopter and has a 3-4 year head
